# Inequality-Mobility-Income-and-Happiness
In this repo you can find all of the documents for one of my PhD comprehensive exams. In this comprehensive exam I took a two-day seminar on multilevel modeling, and then ran, interpreted, and visualized those models.

Specifically, I explored how geographical income inequality and income mobility (i.e., the level of inequality and mobility present in the U.S. county in which one lives) impact the relationship between income and happiness.
